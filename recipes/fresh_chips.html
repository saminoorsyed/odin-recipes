    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are few things better in life that fresh and hot tortilla chips to snack on along with your choice of salsa and beverage. Learn to make your own! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Corn oil (lets keep it thematic)</li>
        <li>Seasoning (your choice, salt is a classic)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Pour enough oil in the pan to give about an inch and a half of height from its bottom</li>
        <li> Heat the oil until it bubbles when a bit of tortilla is added</li>
        <li> While the oil is heating, cut your corn tortillas to the desired shape</li>
        <li> Carefully place soft tortillas into hot oil, flipping them just before golden brown</li>
        <li> Remove fresh chips when they look ready (keep in mind they'll continue to cook a little out of the pot!)</li>
        <li> Season while the oil is still hot</li>
        <li> Save the oil to make chips tomorrow!</li>
    </ol>
